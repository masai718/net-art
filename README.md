For Art 240 Net Art Project
Concept: Based off of tarot card readings; humorous take on reading fortunes; pointing out how people shouldn't always believe what they read on the internet

Main page
  "Pick a pile"
  3 piles that'll link to a randomized fortune
  Remember to have a home button on each page

Fortune pages
  Show the selected tarot cards
  Fortune that should be unrealistic and ridiculous (ex: you will be stung 72 times by bees or your left sock you've been missing for 2 years will show up on your dresser in about 14 minutes)

Video -> how to incorporate? maybe have a page before the main one like an intro with the video in the background
